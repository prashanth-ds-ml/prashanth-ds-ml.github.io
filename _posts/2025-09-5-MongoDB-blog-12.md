# MongoDB CRUD — Mastering Document Deletion for Reliable Data Management

Welcome back to the MongoDB learning series!  
Having explored inserting, updating, and querying documents, today’s focus is on **deleting documents** safely and efficiently — an essential part of real-world app workflows and MongoDB Associate exam material.

***

## Understanding Deletion Operations in MongoDB

MongoDB provides two primary commands for removal:

- **`deleteOne(filter)`** — removes *one* document that matches the filter criteria.
- **`deleteMany(filter)`** — removes *all* documents matching the filter.

Deletion is an irreversible operation, so understanding and using these commands cautiously is critical.

***

## Syntax Overview

```js
db.collection.deleteOne(
  <filter>,
  <options>
)
```

```js
db.collection.deleteMany(
  <filter>,
  <options>
)
```

- `<filter>`: Your criteria to specify which documents to remove.
- `<options>`: Optional parameters like write concern.

***

## Practical Scenario: Cleanup Unengaged Movies

Imagine wanting to clean up the database by removing all movies with zero comments (`num_mflix_comments: 0`).

```js
db.movies.deleteMany({ num_mflix_comments: 0 })
```

This command deletes **all** movies with no comments, improving dataset quality.

***

## Deleting Just One Document

If you only want to delete a single movie by title:

```js
db.movies.deleteOne({ title: "A Very Old Movie" })
```

This removes only the first document matching the title, even if other documents share the same title.

***

## Confirming Deletion Results

After deletion commands, MongoDB returns a confirmation document.

Example:

```json
{
  "acknowledged": true,
  "deletedCount": 3
}
```

- `"acknowledged"` indicates successful receipt of the command.
- `"deletedCount"` tells how many documents were deleted.

***

## Best Practices and Considerations

- Use precise filters to avoid unintended deletions.
- Prefer `deleteOne` when unsure about multiple matches.
- Before deleting many documents, consider backing up or exporting data.
- Deletions affect indexes and overall write performance.
- Use transactions for atomic multi-statement operations when needed.
- Regularly monitor and manage index health post deletions.

***

## Hands-On Example: Delete All Pre-1900 Movies

To remove all movies released before 1900:

```js
db.movies.deleteMany({ year: { $lt: 1900 } })
```

Verify deletion count:

```js
db.movies.countDocuments({ year: { $lt: 1900 } })
```

## Python Driver (PyMongo) Example

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient

client = MongoClient("mongodb+srv://<your-atlas-uri>")
db = client.sample_mflix

result = db.movies.deleteMany({ "num_mflix_comments": 0 })
print(f"Deleted {result.deleted_count} documents.")
```

## Key Exam & Interview Points

- `deleteOne` vs `deleteMany`: One document vs multiple documents.
- `deletedCount` in the response shows removal success.
- Proper filters prevent accidental data loss.
- Deletion commands and their options (write concern, collation).
- Index impact and operation performance considerations.
- Transactions and write atomicity when required.

## Multiple Choice Questions

**Q1:** What happens if you run `db.collection.deleteMany({})` without a filter?  
a) No documents are deleted.  
b) All documents in the collection are deleted.  
c) Only one document is deleted.  
d) The command errors out.

***

**Q2:** Which of the following commands deletes only the first matching document?  
a) `db.collection.remove(filter)`  
b) `db.collection.deleteMany(filter)`  
c) `db.collection.deleteOne(filter)`  
d) `db.collection.findOneAndDelete(filter)`

***

**Q3:** The response to a `deleteOne` operation includes `{ deletedCount: 0 }`. What does this indicate?  
a) The delete command failed.  
b) No documents matched the filter.  
c) Exactly one document was deleted.  
d) Multiple documents were deleted.
