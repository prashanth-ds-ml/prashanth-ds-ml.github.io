title: MongoDB Aggregation Framework — Foundations and Practical Usage
---

# Introduction / Explanation

The **MongoDB Aggregation Framework** enables data analytics and transformation by processing documents through stages such as filtering, grouping, sorting, and projecting. This feature is critical for applications requiring summarization, reporting, or real-time insights, making it a core exam and interview topic for associate developers.[1][2][3][4]

***

# Syntax Breakdown and Explanation

The aggregation pipeline chains multiple stages:

```javascript
db.collection.aggregate([
  { $match: { /* filter conditions */ } },
  { $group: { _id: "$field", total: { $sum: 1 } } },
  { $sort: { total: -1 } }
])
```

- **$match:** Filters input documents using query conditions.
- **$group:** Organizes documents into groups and computes sums, averages, min/max, etc.
- **$sort:** Orders results by specified fields.[2][5]
- **$out:** Writes aggregated results to a new or existing collection; must be last in the pipeline.[2]

Each stage transforms incoming documents, passing output to the next stage. Pipelines can be deeply customized by combining stages in sequence.[6][3]

# Real-Life Examples

## Mongo Shell Example — Group and Sort

Count movies per director and sort by number of movies:

```javascript
db.movies.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: "$director", count: { $sum: 1 } } },
  { $sort: { count: -1 } }
])
```

## PyMongo Example — Average Rating Per Genre

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient

client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
db = client.sample_mflix

pipeline = [
    {"$unwind": "$genres"},  # Unwind genres array
    {"$group": {"_id": "$genres", "avg_rating": {"$avg": "$imdb.rating"}}},
    {"$sort": {"avg_rating": -1}}
]

for doc in db.movies.aggregate(pipeline):
    print(doc)
```
This pipeline unwinds arrays, groups by genre, computes average ratings, and sorts results.[7][8]

# Key Points for Exam and Interviews

- The aggregation pipeline chains **multiple stages** (e.g., $match, $group, $sort) for complex transformations.[5][2]
- **$group** supports accumulators like `$sum`, `$avg`, `$max`, `$min`.[5]
- Pipelines are essential for real-world analytics, reporting, and advanced document processing.[3]
- **$out** stage can export results to another collection, useful for data warehousing.[2]
- Practical knowledge of both shell and PyMongo pipelines is exam-relevant.[4][7]

# Practice MCQs

1. Which aggregation stage groups documents and can calculate totals or averages?  
   a) $match  
   b) $group  
   c) $sort  

2. What does the $sort stage do in a pipeline?  
   a) Removes documents  
   b) Orders the results  
   c) Groups by field  

3. In the aggregation pipeline, which stage must come last if present?  
   a) $match  
   b) $group  
   c) $out
