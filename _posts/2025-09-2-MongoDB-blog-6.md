# MongoDB CRUD — Properly and Improperly Formed Insert Commands

Hey readers! Welcome back to my MongoDB learning series, a part of my preparation for the **MongoDB Associate Python Developer Exam**.

In [Blog 1](https://prashanth-ds-ml.github.io/MongoDB-CRUD-blog-1/), we introduced the basics of inserting documents using the **insertOne()** and **insertMany()** commands. If you missed that, or want a refresher, check it out. Today, we’ll build on that foundation by exploring what makes an insert command **properly formed** versus **improperly formed**—a common topic in the exam.

## Why Proper Insert Commands Matter

- MongoDB collections are schema-flexible, allowing different shapes of documents in the same collection.
- However, correct structure and data types in documents are critical for data integrity, querying efficacy, and maintaining clean, performant databases.
- Improperly formed inserts—even if accepted by MongoDB—can lead to silent errors, inaccurate queries, and bugs downstream in applications.
- Knowing how to spot and correct these issues ensures reliable development and smooth exams.

## Using the Sample Dataset: `sample_mflix.movies`

To ensure practical relevance, we use the **`movies`** collection from MongoDB’s official `sample_mflix` database for examples.

***

## Proper Insert Command Example

```javascript
db.movies.insertOne({
  title: "Inception",
  year: 2010,
  genres: ["Action", "Sci-Fi"],
  directors: ["Christopher Nolan"],
  runtime: 148,
  released: new Date("2010-07-16"),
  awards: { wins: 4, nominations: 10, text: "Won 4 Academy Awards" }
})
```

### Explanation:

- **Required fields** like `title` and `year` are present.
- Data types are appropriate:
  - `title` and `directors`: String or array of strings
  - `year` and `runtime`: Numbers
  - `released`: Date object
  - `awards`: Embedded document to capture structured data
- This kind of document supports flexible queries and efficient indexing.

***

## Examples of Improper Insert Commands

```javascript
// Missing required 'title', wrong data types for 'genres' and 'runtime'
db.movies.insertOne({
  year: 2020,
  genres: "Drama",        // Should be an array, not a string
  runtime: "Two hours"    // Should be a number, not a string
})
```

### Why This is Problematic:

- **Missing Title:** Essential for identifying movies and running meaningful queries.
- **Wrong 'genres' Type:** A string cannot substitute a list; queries expecting arrays will fail.
- **Wrong 'runtime' Type:** Having runtime as text breaks duration comparisons and calculations.

MongoDB may accept this insert, but it breaks data consistency, impacting analytics and app behavior.

## How MongoDB Handles These in Compass mongosh

- The insert succeeds but results in inconsistent data.
- Applications relying on structured data face errors or inaccurate outcomes.
- Schema-free doesn’t mean schema-ignorant: good design and validation are developer responsibilities.
- Using MongoDB’s optional **schema validation** can enforce correct structure in production.

## PyMongo Example for Proper Insert

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
from datetime import datetime

client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
db = client.sample_mflix

movie = {
    "title": "Inception",
    "year": 2010,
    "genres": ["Action", "Sci-Fi"],
    "directors": ["Christopher Nolan"],
    "runtime": 148,
    "released": datetime(2010, 7, 16),
    "awards": {"wins": 4, "nominations": 10, "text": "Won 4 Academy Awards"}
}

db.movies.insert_one(movie)
```

## Key Points for Exam and Interviews

- **Always include required fields** like `title` in movies or equivalent essential fields in your domain.
- Use **correct BSON data types**: arrays for lists, embedded documents for structured info, Date for timestamps.
- MongoDB’s schema flexibility doesn’t excuse poor data hygiene—keep inserts clean and consistent.
- **Improper data types** in fields can cause queries to fail or return incorrect results, possibly unnoticed.
- In production, consider **schema validation rules** to enforce data integrity.
- Knowing how to construct proper insert commands and spot errors is essential in interviews and the certification exam.
- Practicing inserts on MongoDB sample datasets helps solidify understanding and readiness.

## Practice Questions (No Answers)

1. Which of the following is true about the `insertOne()` command?  
   a) It inserts multiple documents at once  
   b) It inserts a single document into a collection  
   c) It updates existing documents  

2. What is wrong with this insert command?  
   ```javascript
   db.movies.insertOne({ genres: "Drama", year: 2015 })
   ```
   a) `genres` should be an array  
   b) `year` should be a string  
   c) Document must include `_id`  

3. Why should you avoid inserting documents with missing required fields?  
   a) MongoDB rejects the insert  
   b) Your queries or reports might fail or give inaccurate results  
   c) The document becomes automatically deleted
