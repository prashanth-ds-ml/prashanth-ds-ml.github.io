# Mastering MongoDB Logical Operators — $and, $or, $not, $nor

Welcome back to the MongoDB learning series!  
Today, we dive into the powerful **logical operators** in MongoDB: `$and`, `$or`, `$not`, and `$nor`. These operators allow you to compose complex queries by combining multiple conditions — an essential skill for the MongoDB Associate Developer exam and effective querying.

***

## 1. Explanation

Logical operators help specify how multiple criteria interact to match documents:

- **`$and`**: Matches documents where *all* conditions are true.
- **`$or`**: Matches documents where *any* condition is true.
- **`$not`**: Negates a given condition.
- **`$nor`**: Matches documents where *none* of the conditions are true.

These operators enable flexible, precise filtering beyond simple conditions.

## 2. Syntax Breakdown and Explanation

| Operator  | Syntax Example                                        | Description                                                        |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`$and`**  | `{ $and: [ {cond1}, {cond2}, ... ] }`                 | Joins multiple conditions by AND; docs must satisfy *all*       |
| **`$or`**   | `{ $or: [ {cond1}, {cond2}, ... ] }`                  | Joins conditions by OR; docs must satisfy *any*                  |
| **`$not`**  | `{ field: { $not: { <condition> } } }`                | Negates condition on a field; matches docs where condition is false |
| **`$nor`**  | `{ $nor: [ {cond1}, {cond2}, ... ] }`                  | Joins conditions by NOR; docs satisfy *none* of the conditions   |

- **`$and`** example:

```js
{ $and: [ { year: { $gt: 2010 } }, { "imdb.rating": { $gt: 8 } } ] }
```

- **`$or`** example:

```js
{ $or: [ { year: { $gt: 2010 } }, { genres: "Sci-Fi" } ] }
```

- **`$not`** example:

```js
{ rated: { $not: { $lt: "PG-13" } } }
```

- **`$nor`** example:

```js
{ $nor: [ { genres: "Comedy" }, { genres: "Drama" } ] }
```

***

## 3. Real-Life Examples

### Find movies released after 2010 *and* rated above 8:

```js
db.movies.find({
  $and: [
    { year: { $gt: 2010 } },
    { "imdb.rating": { $gt: 8 } }
  ]
})
```

### Find movies released after 2010 *or* belonging to Sci-Fi genre:

```js
db.movies.find({
  $or: [
    { year: { $gt: 2010 } },
    { genres: "Sci-Fi" }
  ]
})
```

### Find movies **not** rated below PG-13:

```js
db.movies.find({ rated: { $not: { $lt: "PG-13" } } })
```

### Find movies that are **neither** comedies **nor** dramas:

```js
db.movies.find({
  $nor: [
    { genres: "Comedy" },
    { genres: "Drama" }
  ]
})
```

## 4. Key Points for Exam & Interviews

- MongoDB applies implicit AND between fields; explicit `$and` is used mostly for complex or nested conditions.
- `$or` and `$nor` arrays require conditions to define alternatives or exclusions.
- `$not` negates conditions at the field level and cannot replace `$nor` or `$and`.
- Logical operators can be nested and combined to build intricate queries.
- Understanding operator precedence ensures query accuracy.
- Logical operators are often tested through query output or syntax identification questions.

## 5. Practice MCQs (No answers provided)

**Q1:** Which operator matches documents where *at least one* listed condition is true?  
a) `$and`  
b) `$or`  
c) `$not`  
d) `$nor`  

***

**Q2:** What does the following query return?  
```js
db.movies.find({
  $nor: [{ genres: "Comedy" }, { genres: "Horror" }]
})
```
a) Movies that are Comedy or Horror  
b) Movies that are neither Comedy nor Horror  
c) Only movies labeled Horror  
d) No documents at all  

***

**Q3:** How is the `$not` operator typically used?  
a) To negate a field-specific condition  
b) To combine two or more conditions with OR  
c) To reverse the effect of the entire query  
d) To match documents where field exists
