title: Hello, single-page world
---

Kicking off my single-page portfolio with auto-updating Projects & Blog.

This site is powered by **Jekyll** on GitHub Pages. I write posts in Markdown, drop them into `_posts/`, and the homepage updates automatically. <!--more-->

## Why single page?
- Fast to skim: intro → projects → blog in one scroll.
- Low maintenance: projects from `_data/projects.yml`, posts from `_posts/`.

Next up: notes on my MSME RAG chatbot architecture and SmartCBC experiments.
